Thank you very much for your kind words and encouragement. I am truly grateful for this recognition.

This achievement is also a reflection of the strong team and supportive environment I am fortunate to be part of. I would especially like to acknowledge my manager, Ram, whose constant encouragement to think wide and challenge myself has played a significant role in my growth.

I remain committed to contributing meaningfully as we move into this next phase of growth and delivering consistent impact for the organization.

Thank you once again for your guidance and leadership.
